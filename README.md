# üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

1. **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer:** This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
